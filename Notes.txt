An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Arrays can be classified into two categories: 

Fixed-sized arrays:
    Heap Storage
Dynamic-sized arrays
    Array List
